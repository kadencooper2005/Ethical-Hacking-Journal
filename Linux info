# Linux info
Daemons: a daemon in linux is a computer program that runs in the background without the need for 
user-input. Daemons are designed to perform various system level task and provide services with 
the need of direct user input like said. they are a fundamental part of the Linuz OS functionality, 
ensuring that essential services are always available.
Daemons are usually identified by having a d at the end of their name, such as: sshd, which would be the SSH daemon, 
crond. which would be the crontab schedular daemon etc. in modern Linux, daemons are managed by the init system like systemd, 
which handles their startup, shutdown, and monitoring. 

## Linux Commands

ls        # list all content in a dir
cd        # switches dir
ls -la    # list hidden files
echo      # output content
mv        # moves a file
cp        # copies files
locate    # finds files you name
grep      # pulls out the line
cut       # cuts a line (-d specifies delimiter)
wget      # file transfer command
ps aux    # displays all running processes on the system
mysql: this is used to connect to a mysql server/database. syntax is mysql -h <IP_ADDRESS> -u <USER> 
smbclient: to check share etc 


# Permissions
chmod +x         # add execute permission
chmod 777        # read, write, execute for all
chmod u+s        # assigns the (Set-User-ID)SUID on a file

# User Management
adduser          # adds user
cat /etc/passwd  # view users and UIDs
cat /etc/shadow  # view password hashes
su               # switch user

Permissions Format (ls -la):

  File/folder owner

  Group owner

  Others

  rw: read/write

  rwx: read/write/execute

   - = file, d = directory

🌐 Network Commands

ifconfig       # view network info
iwconfig       # for wireless hacking
ping           # test connectivity
arp -a         # list IP and MAC address pairs
netstat -ano   # show open ports and connections
route          # display routing info

# cron/crontab
is a time based job scheduler in unix-like operating systems.
it automates the execution of taks at specific intervals

cronjob is used to manage cron


# Installing Tools & Starting Services

apt-get install <tool>               # install tools
service apache2 start               # start Apache web server
service postgresql start            # start PostgreSQL
systemctl enable ssh                # enable SSH
systemctl enable postgresql         # start PostgreSQL at boot
python3 -m http.server 80           # start Python web server



ROP chain (Return-Oriented Programming)

Modern systems use security features like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) to stop code execution 
from memory regions like the stack. 
That means classic buffer overflow exploits that inject shellcode directly 
into the stack often fail because that memory is marked non-executable.

How ROP works:
Instead of injecting new code, you reuse existing code from the binary or libraries already loaded into memory.
You look for short instruction sequences ending with ret (called gadgets).

You chain gadgets together to perform complex actions, like calling system("/bin/sh").
You build a “chain” of return addresses so when your overflow triggers, execution jumps through these gadgets.
Key takeaway: ROP is about turning the program’s own code into a scripting language to bypass DEP.


Shellcode Writing
What it is:
Shellcode is small, position-independent machine code used as a payload in exploits. Traditionally, 
it spawns a shell (/bin/sh), but modern shellcode can also:

Download and execute files
Open reverse TCP connections
Escalate privileges

How you do it:
Write simple assembly (x86 or x64) to perform system calls (like execve).
Assemble it with tools like nasm.
Extract the raw bytes and inject them into your exploit payload.
Key constraint: Shellcode must avoid null bytes (\x00) because they terminate strings in vulnerable programs.


ASLR and DEP Bypass

What they are:
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization): Randomizes memory addresses of key program areas (stack, heap, libraries) so you can’t reliably jump to them.
DEP (Data Execution Prevention): Marks memory pages as non-executable to prevent direct shellcode execution.

How attackers bypass these:
Info leaks: Use bugs to leak memory addresses, defeating ASLR.
ROP chains: As discussed, use ROP to avoid DEP entirely.
JIT spraying / heap spraying: Fill memory with predictable patterns.
Return-to-libc: Jump directly into library functions (like system()) instead of shellcode.
