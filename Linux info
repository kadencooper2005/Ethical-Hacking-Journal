# Linux info
Daemons: a daemon in linux is a computer program that runs in the background without the need for 
user-input. Daemons are designed to perform various system level task and provide services with 
the need of direct user input like said. they are a fundamental part of the Linuz OS functionality, 
ensuring that essential services are always available.
Daemons are usually identified by having a d at the end of their name, such as: sshd, which would be the SSH daemon, 
crond. which would be the crontab schedular daemon etc. in modern Linux, daemons are managed by the init system like systemd, 
which handles their startup, shutdown, and monitoring. 

## Linux Commands

ls        # list all content in a dir
cd        # switches dir
ls -la    # list hidden files
echo      # output content
mv        # moves a file
cp        # copies files
locate    # finds files you name
grep      # pulls out the line
cut       # cuts a line (-d specifies delimiter)
wget      # file transfer command
ps aux    # displays all running processes on the system
mysql: this is used to connect to a mysql server/database. syntax is mysql -h <IP_ADDRESS> -u <USER> 
smbclient: to check share etc 




# Active Directory (AD) Attack Reference

Active Directory is a centralized identity and access management system.  
It stores all users, groups, computers, permissions, and security policies, and controls authentication (proving who you are) and authorization (deciding what you can do).

---

## 1. Password & Authentication Attacks

Kerberoasting — Request Kerberos service tickets for accounts with SPNs, then crack them offline. 

AS-REP Roasting — Request encrypted authentication data for users without pre-authentication and crack it offline. 

Password Spraying — Try a common password across many accounts to avoid lockouts. 

Brute Force — Repeatedly guess one user’s password until it works. 

Credential Dumping — Extract credentials from memory (LSASS), SAM, or LSADump.

Token Theft / Impersonation — Steal authentication tokens from a logged-in session. 

Overpass-the-Hash — Use an NTLM hash to request a Kerberos ticket. Analogy: Turn a stamp into a full hall pass.

Unconstrained Delegation Abuse — Impersonate any user who connects to your service. 
Constrained Delegation Abuse — Impersonate a user for specific services. 

---

## 2. Trust & Relationship Exploits

SID History Injection — Inject privileged SIDs into a user’s SID history. 

Foreign Security Principal Abuse — Abuse trust relationships between domains. 

Inter-Domain Trust Exploitation — Abuse weak trust rules between domains or forests. 

---

## 3. Lateral Movement

WMI / DCOM Abuse — Remotely execute commands via WMI or DCOM. 

PSExec — Remotely execute commands using service accounts. 

RDP Hijacking — Take over another user’s existing RDP session. 

---

## 4. Persistence

AdminSDHolder Abuse — Modify the AdminSDHolder object so you stay admin even after permission resets. 

Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse — Deploy malicious policies to multiple machines. 

Startup / Logon Scripts — Deploy persistence via scripts that run on boot or login. 

Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) Backdoor — Abuse the DSRM account for emergency access. 

---

## 5. Weak Configuration Exploits

MS14-068 — Kerberos validation flaw that allows privilege escalation. 

Printer Bug — Abuse the print spooler service to coerce authentication. 

PetitPotam — Force a Domain Controller to authenticate to you via NTLM. 

Zerologon — Exploit Netlogon flaw to reset a DC’s password to blank. 
---

## 6. Domain Controller Direct Attacks

Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) Theft — Copy VSS data to extract credentials. 

NTDS.dit Extraction — Steal the AD database with all password hashes. 

LSASS Injection — Inject into LSASS to dump credentials. 

---

## 7. Social & Hybrid Attacks

Phishing for Domain Credentials — Trick a user into revealing credentials. 

Credential Reuse — Use stolen credentials from another service. 

Service Account Abuse — Target accounts with excessive privileges. 

---

## Core Goals of AD Attacks

Obtain Credentials — Passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets.

Escalate Privileges — Move from a normal account to admin or Domain Controller.

Persistence — Maintain long-term access and survive cleanup efforts.

# Permissions
chmod +x         # add execute permission
chmod 777        # read, write, execute for all
chmod u+s        # assigns the (Set-User-ID)SUID on a file

# User Management
adduser          # adds user
cat /etc/passwd  # view users and UIDs
cat /etc/shadow  # view password hashes
su               # switch user

Permissions Format (ls -la):

  File/folder owner

  Group owner

  Others

  rw: read/write

  rwx: read/write/execute

   - = file, d = directory

ifconfig       # view network info
iwconfig       # for wireless hacking
ping           # test connectivity
arp -a         # list IP and MAC address pairs
netstat -ano   # show open ports and connections
route          # display routing info

is a time based job scheduler in unix-like operating systems.
it automates the execution of taks at specific intervals

cronjob is used to manage cron
