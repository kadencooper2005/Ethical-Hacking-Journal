# OS internals

this includes knowledge about the lower-level system, inlcuding the Kernel. 
The kernel could be considered the "Heart" of the OS, as it is responsible for many things such as memory management,
I/O, devices, processors, and system calls. exploiting the kernal would lead to full take over of the OS itself. 

this could be dangerous if abused; potentially leading to a bricked system aka (BSOD on Windows, and Kernel Panick in Linux)

There are a various amount of ways to exploit the OS on a lower level via process injection, overflow attacks, binary exploitation
and so on. 

most of the time, when working with the OS on a lower level, you'll use programming languages such as C and Assembly for more
accurate and precise control over the system itself. 

unlike userland exploits, kernel exploits will survive a reboot if a rootkit or module is installed 

Kernel-level rootkits can hide themselves from almost every tool (task manager, antivirus, ls/ps commands).

You own the machine: every file, process, network connection is yours if exploited properly. 


#  Cyber Kill Chain

The **Cyber Kill Chain** (developed by Lockheed Martin) is a model for understanding the phases of a cyberattack.  
It helps defenders identify where they can detect, deny, disrupt, or contain an attack.

##   Stages

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Attacker gathers information about the target (e.g., ports, services, employees).
   - Goal: Identify weak points.

2. **Weaponization**
   - Combine exploit + payload into a “weapon.”
   - Example: malicious PDF, Word doc with macro, exploit-laden executable.

3. **Delivery**
   - Send the weapon to the victim.
   - Channels: phishing, USB drop, malicious website, supply chain.

4. **Exploitation**
   - Code execution on the target system.
   - Example: buffer overflow, macro execution.

5. **Installation**
   - Establish persistence by installing malware/backdoor.
   - Example: registry changes, scheduled tasks, services.

6. **Command & Control (C2)**
   - Attacker connects to the compromised host to issue commands.
   - Techniques: HTTP/S beaconing, DNS tunneling, custom protocols.

7. **Actions on Objectives**
   - Final goal of the campaign: data exfiltration, lateral movement, disruption, ransomware.

##  Defensive Use

- **Detect early:** Spot recon or phishing attempts.  
- **Disrupt mid-chain:** Block installs, isolate C2.  
- **Contain late:** Limit lateral movement, protect crown jewels.  

>  *The earlier you break the chain, the cheaper and easier the defense.*
