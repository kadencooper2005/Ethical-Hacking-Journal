# Active Directory (AD) Attack Reference

Active Directory is a centralized identity and access management system.  
It stores all users, groups, computers, permissions, and security policies, and controls authentication (proving who you are) and authorization (deciding what you can do).

---

## 1. Password & Authentication Attacks

Kerberoasting — Request Kerberos service tickets for accounts with SPNs, then crack them offline. 

AS-REP Roasting — Request encrypted authentication data for users without pre-authentication and crack it offline. 

Password Spraying — Try a common password across many accounts to avoid lockouts. 

Brute Force — Repeatedly guess one user’s password until it works. 

Credential Dumping — Extract credentials from memory (LSASS), SAM, or LSADump.

Token Theft / Impersonation — Steal authentication tokens from a logged-in session. 

Overpass-the-Hash — Use an NTLM hash to request a Kerberos ticket. Analogy: Turn a stamp into a full hall pass.

Unconstrained Delegation Abuse — Impersonate any user who connects to your service. 
Constrained Delegation Abuse — Impersonate a user for specific services. 

---

## 2. Trust & Relationship Exploits

SID History Injection — Inject privileged SIDs into a user’s SID history. 

Foreign Security Principal Abuse — Abuse trust relationships between domains. 

Inter-Domain Trust Exploitation — Abuse weak trust rules between domains or forests. 

---

## 3. Lateral Movement

WMI / DCOM Abuse — Remotely execute commands via WMI or DCOM. 

PSExec — Remotely execute commands using service accounts. 

RDP Hijacking — Take over another user’s existing RDP session. 

---

## 4. Persistence

AdminSDHolder Abuse — Modify the AdminSDHolder object so you stay admin even after permission resets. 

Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse — Deploy malicious policies to multiple machines. 

Startup / Logon Scripts — Deploy persistence via scripts that run on boot or login. 

Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) Backdoor — Abuse the DSRM account for emergency access. 

---

## 5. Weak Configuration Exploits

MS14-068 — Kerberos validation flaw that allows privilege escalation. 

Printer Bug — Abuse the print spooler service to coerce authentication. 

PetitPotam — Force a Domain Controller to authenticate to you via NTLM. 

Zerologon — Exploit Netlogon flaw to reset a DC’s password to blank. 
---

## 6. Domain Controller Direct Attacks

Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) Theft — Copy VSS data to extract credentials. 

NTDS.dit Extraction — Steal the AD database with all password hashes. 

LSASS Injection — Inject into LSASS to dump credentials. 

---

## 7. Social & Hybrid Attacks

Phishing for Domain Credentials — Trick a user into revealing credentials. 

Credential Reuse — Use stolen credentials from another service. 

Service Account Abuse — Target accounts with excessive privileges. 

---

## Core Goals of AD Attacks

Obtain Credentials — Passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets.

Escalate Privileges — Move from a normal account to admin or Domain Controller.

Persistence — Maintain long-term access and survive cleanup efforts.

# Tools for exploiting AD

bloodhound - used to map relationships within an Active Directory, Entra, and Azure environments.

bloodyAD - Used to perform AD priv escalation 

targetedKeroberos - can perform a number of Keroberoasting attacks

gMSADumper - Reads any gMSA password blobs the user can access and parses the values.




# AD permissions

GenericAll – Full control over the object, including password and group membership changes.

GenericWrite – Can modify most attributes of an object, but not full control.

WriteSPN – Allows writing Service Principal Names, enabling Kerberoasting attacks.

ResetPassword – Lets you reset the user’s password.

AddMember – Permission to add a user to a group.

RemoveMember – Permission to remove a user from a group.

WriteDacl – Modify the object’s permissions (ACL).

WriteOwner – Change ownership of the object.

ValidatedWriteTo – Modify security-sensitive attributes like SID history or UPN.

ValidatedWriteToSamAccountName – Specifically allows changing the SAM account name safely.

ReadProperty – Read specific attributes of an object.

WriteProperty – Write specific attributes of an object.

AllExtendedRights – Perform extended actions like “Reset Password” or “Send As.”

RemoteControl – Control a computer remotely (usually for workstation or server objects).


# Tools to use against AD

crackmapexec (CME) is a post-exploitation tool used mainly for Active Directory environments.
It allows you to:
- Enumerate information (users, shares, OS versions, domain info)
- Authenticate using credentials, NTLM hashes, or Kerberos tickets
- Execute commands remotely

Supported Protocols:
--------------------
- SMB
- RDP
- WinRM
- LDAP
- MSSQL

Basic Syntax:
-------------
crackmapexec <protocol> <target(s)> [options]


use smbclient -L // <TARGET_IP> -U '<DOMAIN>\<USER>%<PASS>' to view any shares, 
their names, type of share, and any comments.

port 445 is for SMB, should always check

Port 88/tcp (Kerberos): Runs Microsoft Windows Kerberos, 
confirming the presence of an AD environment with Kerberos authentication.

Port 464/tcp (kpasswd5): Kerberos password change service, 
part of the AD authentication infrastructure.

CPE - (Common Platform Enumeration)
Clock Skew: - coudl affect Kerberos authentication if not synced.
