# Active Directory (AD) Attack Reference

Active Directory is a centralized identity and access management system.  
It stores all users, groups, computers, permissions, and security policies, and controls authentication (proving who you are) and authorization (deciding what you can do).

---

## 1. Password & Authentication Attacks

Kerberoasting — Request Kerberos service tickets for accounts with SPNs, then crack them offline. 

AS-REP Roasting — Request encrypted authentication data for users without pre-authentication and crack it offline. 

Password Spraying — Try a common password across many accounts to avoid lockouts. 

Brute Force — Repeatedly guess one user’s password until it works. 

Credential Dumping — Extract credentials from memory (LSASS), SAM, or LSADump.

Token Theft / Impersonation — Steal authentication tokens from a logged-in session. 

Overpass-the-Hash — Use an NTLM hash to request a Kerberos ticket. Analogy: Turn a stamp into a full hall pass.

Unconstrained Delegation Abuse — Impersonate any user who connects to your service. 
Constrained Delegation Abuse — Impersonate a user for specific services. 

---

## 2. Trust & Relationship Exploits

SID History Injection — Inject privileged SIDs into a user’s SID history. 

Foreign Security Principal Abuse — Abuse trust relationships between domains. 

Inter-Domain Trust Exploitation — Abuse weak trust rules between domains or forests. 

---

## 3. Lateral Movement

WMI / DCOM Abuse — Remotely execute commands via WMI or DCOM. 

PSExec — Remotely execute commands using service accounts. 

RDP Hijacking — Take over another user’s existing RDP session. 

---

## 4. Persistence

AdminSDHolder Abuse — Modify the AdminSDHolder object so you stay admin even after permission resets. 

Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse — Deploy malicious policies to multiple machines. 

Startup / Logon Scripts — Deploy persistence via scripts that run on boot or login. 

Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) Backdoor — Abuse the DSRM account for emergency access. 

---

## 5. Weak Configuration Exploits

MS14-068 — Kerberos validation flaw that allows privilege escalation. 

Printer Bug — Abuse the print spooler service to coerce authentication. 

PetitPotam — Force a Domain Controller to authenticate to you via NTLM. 

Zerologon — Exploit Netlogon flaw to reset a DC’s password to blank. 
---

## 6. Domain Controller Direct Attacks

Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) Theft — Copy VSS data to extract credentials. 

NTDS.dit Extraction — Steal the AD database with all password hashes. 

LSASS Injection — Inject into LSASS to dump credentials. 

---

## 7. Social & Hybrid Attacks

Phishing for Domain Credentials — Trick a user into revealing credentials. 

Credential Reuse — Use stolen credentials from another service. 

Service Account Abuse — Target accounts with excessive privileges. 

---

## Core Goals of AD Attacks

Obtain Credentials — Passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets.

Escalate Privileges — Move from a normal account to admin or Domain Controller.

Persistence — Maintain long-term access and survive cleanup efforts.
