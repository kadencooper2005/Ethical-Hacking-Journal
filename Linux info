# Linux info
Daemons: a daemon in linux is a computer program that runs in the background without the need for 
user-input. Daemons are designed to perform various system level task and provide services with 
the need of direct user input like said. they are a fundamental part of the Linuz OS functionality, 
ensuring that essential services are always available.
Daemons are usually identified by having a d at the end of their name, such as: sshd, which would be the SSH daemon, 
crond. which would be the crontab schedular daemon etc. in modern Linux, daemons are managed by the init system like systemd, 
which handles their startup, shutdown, and monitoring.
